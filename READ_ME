##About Project

In this global pandemic of COVID-19, there is a critical need for self-protective devices, the most important of them is a face mask.
Our projectâ€™s main aim is for identifying the presence of a face mask on person's face. A strategy should be formulated to make the people accept this essential 
safety measure. To check this, a face mask detector system should be used. To check the presence of a facemask on a human face, the primary step is the detection of
human face. This can be divided into two parts: verifying faces on the images and detection of masks on their faces. Face masks are used to prevent cross-contamination 
as part of an infection control strategy.
